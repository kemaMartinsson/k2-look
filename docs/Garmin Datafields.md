**When building your dashboards, follow the example below:**

**(1,2,47)(33,34,38)(10,18,29)(0)** will display :

-   Screen n°1 : (1 = Elapsed Time, 2 = Distance, 47 = Heart rate zone widget)
    
-   Screen n°2 : (33 = Lap Time, 34 = Lap Distance, 38 = Lap avg. Pace)
    
-   Screen n°3 : (10 = Power 3", 18 = Cadence, 29 = Vertical Oscillation)
    
-   Screen n°4 : (0 = empty screen, display Off.)
    

_Please refer to your **[ActiveLook x Garmin guide](https://www.activelook.net/pages/garmin-device)** to learn how to edit your dashboards._

​_(1) **Using a Stryd or other running power sensor ?**_

Please refer to this [article for details on connection.](https://intercom.help/engo-eyewear/en/articles/11055491-connecting-stryd-with-garmin-for-engo-glasses-power-display)

_(2) **About Cadence**: Works for both Running & Cycling (spm and rpm, respectively). This will require a sensor unless your watch supports running dynamics._
