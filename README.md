## Repository Structure

```
/
├── app/                    # Main application code
├── reference/              # Vendored dependencies (included in repo)
│   ├── android-sdk/       # ActiveLook Android SDK (v4.5.6)
│   └── karoo-ext/         # Karoo Extensions SDK (v1.1.7)
└── [gradle files]
```

## Reference Projects

The `reference/` directory contains **vendored copies** of upstream repositories that are **included
directly in this repository**. These provide source code for the ActiveLook SDK and Karoo Extensions
library that the app builds against.

**Why vendored instead of downloaded?**

- Ensures consistent builds across all environments
- CI/CD pipelines work without external dependencies
- Custom build fixes are maintained across updates
- No authentication required for building

**Included projects:**

- **`reference/android-sdk`
  ** → [ActiveLook Android SDK](https://github.com/ActiveLook/android-sdk) (v4.5.6)
- **`reference/karoo-ext`** → [Karoo Extensions](https://github.com/hammerheadnav/karoo-ext) (
  v1.1.7)

These are committed to the repository, so **no setup scripts are needed** - just clone and build!

> **Note:** The `setup-references.*` and `update-references.*` scripts in the repository root are *
*deprecated** and no longer needed since reference projects are now vendored directly in the repo.

### Cloning This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kemaMartinsson/k2-look.git
cd k2-look
.\gradlew :app:assembleDebug  # That's it! Reference projects are already included
```

## Development Setup

### Install Android Studio

1. **Download Android Studio**
    - Visit [developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
    - Download the latest stable version for Windows

2. **Install Android Studio**
    - Run the installer
    - Follow the setup wizard (install Android SDK, Android Virtual Device)
    - Choose "Standard" installation type

3. **Configure Android SDK**
    - Open Android Studio
    - Go to **Settings → Appearance & Behavior → System Settings → Android SDK**
    - Ensure these are installed:
        - Android SDK Platform 30 (or higher)
        - Android SDK Build-Tools 30.0.3 (or higher)
        - Android SDK Platform-Tools

4. **Open the Project**
    - In Android Studio: **File → Open**
    - Navigate to the cloned repository directory
    - Let Gradle sync (may take several minutes on first run)

### Alternative: VSCode with Dev Container

For developers who prefer Visual Studio Code, a devcontainer configuration is available (currently
disabled):

1. **Enable the Dev Container:**
    - Rename `.devcontainer.disabled/` to `.devcontainer/`
    - This folder contains Docker configuration for a complete Android development environment

2. **Prerequisites:**
    - Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
    - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - Install the "Dev Containers" extension in VSCode

3. **Open in Container:**
    - Open VSCode
    - Press **F1** and select **"Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container..."**
    - Navigate to the cloned repository
    - VSCode will build and start the development container (first time takes several minutes)

4. **Build in Container:**
    - Once the container is running, open the integrated terminal
    - Run: `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`

> **Note:** The devcontainer is disabled by default to avoid confusion for Android Studio users. It
> provides a consistent Linux-based development environment with all necessary tools pre-installed.

## Quick Start

### 1. Building

```bash
.\gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

**Expected output:** APK in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

### 2. Installation on Karoo2

**Via ADB (recommended for development):**

```bash
adb devices  # Verify Karoo2 is connected
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/*.apk
```

**Via File Transfer:**
Transfer the APK to your Karoo2 and install it.

### 3. First Run

1. Launch "K2Look" on your Karoo2
2. Grant Bluetooth and Location permissions when prompted
3. **Go to "Datafields" tab** to configure your display:
    - Create a profile or use the Default profile
    - Select metrics to display
    - Choose visualization styles (Text, Gauge, Bar, Zoned Bar)
    - Pick a layout template (1-6 fields)
4. **Go to "Status" tab** to connect to your glasses:
    - Turn on your ActiveLook glasses
    - Tap **"Scan for Glasses"**
    - Select your glasses from the list
    - Wait for "Connected" status
5. **Start a ride** - Your custom layout appears on your glasses automatically!

> **💡 Pro Tip:** Create multiple profiles with different names matching your Karoo ride profiles for
> automatic switching!

## Architecture

```
User Configuration (DataField Builder)
        ↓
DataFieldProfile → LayoutBuilderViewModel
        ↓
Karoo2 Sensors → KarooSystemService → KarooDataService
                                            ↓
                                  KarooActiveLookBridge
                                     (transformation + layout engine)
                                            ↓
                              ActiveLookService → Glasses Display
                              (Text/Gauge/Bar/Zoned Bar rendering)
```

**Key Components:**

- **LayoutBuilderViewModel** - Profile and layout management
- **DataFieldProfile** - User-defined metrics and visualization configurations
- **KarooDataService** - Consumes Karoo data streams (23 metrics)
- **ActiveLookService** - Manages BLE connection and display rendering
- **KarooActiveLookBridge** - Coordinates both services, transforms data, applies layouts
- **MainViewModel** - UI state management
- **MainScreen** - Jetpack Compose UI with 4 tabs (Status, Datafields, Debug, About)
